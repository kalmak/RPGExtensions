# RPGExtensions
Extensions for Game Grind Simple RPG. Each extension is independent and contained in its own folder. They do work on the code base started by Austin so you cannot just grab them and drop them in a fresh project.

License: You are free to use or modify this code in any game that you wish. Acknowledgement in the credits would be appreciated but is not required. You may not bundle this code into any non-game project. You may not sell the extensions in the Unity Asset Store.
